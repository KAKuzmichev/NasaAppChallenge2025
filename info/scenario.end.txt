Screenplay: The Discovery of Life - The "R.O.M.A.N." Telescope Report (English Translation)
Location: Deep Space, NASA Mission Control Center (MCC) in Houston, and NASA Main Auditorium.
Time: Night, Present Day.

SCENE 1: DEEP SPACE
INT. "R.O.M.A.N." SPACE TELESCOPE - NIGHT

Silence. Only the faint flicker of control panel lights. A view through the viewport: infinite blackness, scattered with stars.

The camera focuses on the "R.O.M.A.N." SPACE TELESCOPE – a futuristic structure drifting in deep space.

CLOSE UP on the telescope's main camera.
It slowly turns, aiming at a tiny distant dot — an EXOPLANET.

The sound of mechanisms working.
A flash — the telescope takes an image.

AUTOMATED VOICE (O.S.):

Image acquired. File: ExoAlpha−47. Initiating data transmission to NASA MCC.

SCENE 2: NASA DATA PROCESSING CENTER (PREPARATION)
INT. IMAGE PROCESSING LAB, NASA MCC - NIGHT

The room is dimly lit, illuminated only by numerous monitors.

ALICE (30s-40s, a data operator, composed and focused) sits at her desk, drinking cold coffee. She stares intently at the monitor.

On the main monitor, the data transmission indicator from R.O.M.A.N. is rapidly filling up.

ALICE:

It's so late. This data was due three hours ago. What did you see out there, "R.O.M.A.N."?

SOUND — transmission complete.

A RAW file appears on the screen. It looks unusually bright. Alice begins to work. Her fingers move quickly across the keyboard. She applies correction and spectral analysis algorithms.

The blurry image on the screen sharpens. A bluish atmosphere and dark patches resembling continents become visible.
The spectral analysis data (graphs) show high concentrations of Oxygen (O
2
​
 ), Methane (CH
4
​
 ), and Water Vapor (H
2
​
 O) — clear biosignatures.

ALICE (Whispering, disbelieving):

Oh my God. That’s a Class Five biosignature. This isn't a mistake.

SCENE 3: CROSS-VERIFICATION
INT. IMAGE PROCESSING LAB, NASA MCC - CONTINUOUS

Alice calls her superior.

ALICE (Loudly, into the voice chat):

Calling Dr. CARTER. I need an immediate review of R.O.M.A.N. data ExoAlpha−47.

DR. CARTER (50s, skeptical astrophysicist) appears on the video screen, looking annoyed at being woken up.

DR. CARTER:

Alice, you know the protocol. Quality processing, then a report. Don't yell at me in the middle of the night.

ALICE:

I've uploaded the processed data to the server. Look at the Methane and Oxygen levels, Doctor. And the P
L
​
  coefficient. It's higher than we've ever seen.

Dr. Carter quickly opens the file on his computer. His face on the screen changes — from annoyance to shock.

DR. CARTER:

(Whisper) Unbelievable... 98.2%. This... this is a "Locus of Life."

ALICE:

Exactly. I'm uploading the data to the "ATLAS" site for final verification and coordinate retrieval.

SCENE 4: INTERACTION WITH "ATLAS"
INT. IMAGE PROCESSING LAB, NASA MCC - CONTINUOUS

Alice opens the "ATLAS" WEBSITE INTERFACE — a minimalist, scientific portal where all exoplanet data is compiled.

Alice drags the processed ExoAlpha−47 file into the "Analysis and Coordinates" window.
The "Processing..." indicator blinks for a few tense seconds.

A red warning appears:

ATTENTION: POTENTIALLY REVOLUTIONARY DATA. FINAL COMPILATION REQUIRED.

Alice clicks "Compile."
A LIST OF COORDINATES and a three-dimensional model of the planet appear.
Headline: CANDIDATES WITH HIGH PROBABILITY OF LIFE (P
L
​
 >0.95).

ALICE:

(Exclaiming) We have coordinates! R.A. 11h 23m 47.9s, Dec. -12° 49’ 16.7”! Crater Constellation!

She quickly saves the final report.

DR. CARTER (Appearing back on her screen, now dressed and ready to leave):

Immediately upload the presentation to the Main Auditorium. I'm calling Director Gammon. This can't wait until morning.

SCENE 5: NASA MAIN AUDITORIUM (COMMOTION)
INT. NASA MAIN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

The Main Auditorium is buzzing. Although it is late at night, several operators quickly arrive, alerted by the emergency call.

DIRECTOR GAMMON (50s-60s, gray-haired, authoritative) rapidly approaches the main console, with DR. CARTER beside him.

The GIANT PROJECTION SCREEN dominates the front wall. It currently displays a general map of current missions.

DIRECTOR GAMMON:

Carter, are you sure? In the middle of the night?

DR. CARTER:

It's 98.2%, Director. If this doesn't warrant urgency, I don't know what does. These are R.O.M.A.N. data; they are always precise.

A green indicator lights up on Director Gammon's console: "Data ready for projection."

SCENE 6: PROJECTION: THE DISCOVERY
INT. NASA MAIN AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

DIRECTOR GAMMON:

Load the final ExoAlpha−47 presentation.

The image of current missions on the GIANT SCREEN vanishes.
The screen switches to GALAXY MAP mode.

ALICE (O.S., voice is formal and clear):

We present the final map of probable habitable worlds, calculated based on biosignatures obtained by the R.O.M.A.N. telescope.

Tiny GREEN DOTS begin to appear on the screen — these are the newly found candidates.
One dot, EXOPLANET ExoAlpha−47, flashes brighter than the others, accompanied by a large HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION of a three-dimensional model. It is a blue, cloudy, unmistakably alive planet.

Key data appears on the projection:

NAME: ExoAlpha-47

CONSTELLATION: Crater

BIOSIGNATURES: O
2
​
 ,CH
4
​
 ,H
2
​
 O

PROBABILITY OF LIFE (P
L
​
 ): 0.982

The room is in absolute silence, followed by a collective GASP OF SHOCK.

DR. CARTER (Voice broken):

We... we are seeing life. This is not just a hypothesis. It's a fact.

SCENE 7: THE WORLD'S REACTION
INT. DIRECTOR GAMMON'S OFFICE - MORNING

Director Gammon stands by the window, watching the sunrise. Alice and Dr. Carter stand in his office. The tension in the room is palpable.

DIRECTOR GAMMON:

The news broke 15 minutes ago. Markets are dropping. The media is going crazy. Politicians are demanding clarification.

ALICE:

But, sir, the data is impeccable. R.O.M.A.N. is working.

DIRECTOR GAMMON:

(He turns to them, his face tired but determined) I don't doubt the data, Alice. I'm thinking about the consequences. We just changed humanity's place in the universe. And we did it in the middle of the night.

He walks over to a large screen that still projects the rotating blue planet, ExoAlpha−47.

DIRECTOR GAMMON:

We're holding a press conference this morning. I want both of you there. And I want that image to be the first thing the world sees.

The camera focuses on the screen with the Exoplanet.

FADE OUT.
